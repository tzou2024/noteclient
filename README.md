# Techonologies Used

## React.js

React.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to build fast and efficient web applications using the minimum amount of code possible. In React.js, you can break the web layout into components - reusable bits of code that return HTML elements.

## Chakra UI Library 

Chakra UI is a library that allows you to build stunning and modern web applications using various layout components. It differs from other UI frameworks in that it offers accessibility and dark mode support by default. 

With Chakra UI, you spend less time building responsive and beautiful websites. If you want to create a web application that allows users to switch between different color modes with minimal lines of code, then Chakra UI is an excellent choice.

## How to use it 

- Install `NodejS` - version 14.x or higher 
- Install dependencies via `yarn`
- Start the project: `yarn start` 

## Formik 
Let's face it, forms are really verbose in React. To make matters worse, most form helpers do wayyyy too much magic and often have a significant performance cost associated with them. Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts:

Getting values in and out of form state
Validation and error messages
Handling form submission
By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze.

## Installation
You can install Formik with NPM, Yarn, or a good ol' `<script>` via unpkg.com.

NPM
 npm install formik --save
or
 yarn add formik

Formik is compatible with React v15+ and works with ReactDOM and React Native.

## Installing Dependencies
Dependencies are stored in [`package.json.`](package.json) To install these dependencies, run npm install.
